You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int d[n+1];
        ///内存溢出
        ///
        d[0]=1;
        d[1]=1;
        int i = 2;
        while(i<=n){
            d[i]=d[i-1]+d[i-2];
            i++;
        }
        return d[n];
    }
};
